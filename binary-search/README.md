# 🔍 Binary Search

Divide and conquer, reducing the area by half each time.  
First step: **sort an array**.

- **Worst case:** `n` is in the last division or doesn’t exist at all → **O(log n)**
- **Best case:** `n` is in the midpoint → **Ω(1)**
- If the array isn’t sorted, binary search doesn’t work at all.
