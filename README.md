# üöÄ Swift Competitive Programming & Interview Prep

Welcome! This repository documents my journey to **master Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and prepare for **technical interviews** by solving coding problems in **Swift**.

The goal is simple:

- Build a strong foundation in algorithms and problem-solving.
- Use Swift (not just Python or C++) to show its power for interviews and coding challenges.
- Create a beginner-friendly learning resource for others to follow.

## üéØ About This Project

This repo started as part of a personal challenge:

> **‚ÄúLearn Swift for job interview preparation.‚Äù**

I wanted to understand how competitive programming concepts like sorting, binary search, recursion, and dynamic programming connect to real-world job interviews. Instead of keeping my notes private, I decided to create a **public portfolio** where:

- Every topic has a **simple explanation** in Markdown.
- Each problem has a **Swift solution** with comments.
- Others can clone this repo and practice solving problems too.

## üß© What You‚Äôll Find Here

- **Topic-based organization**: Algorithms and concepts grouped into folders (arrays, binary search, sorting, recursion, etc.).
- **Readable theory summaries**: Each folder has a `README.md` that explains the concept in **plain English** (like flashcards).
- **Swift code examples**: Easy-to-read, well-documented Swift solutions for LeetCode and similar problems.
- **Interview-focused patterns**: Templates and reusable snippets to save time in coding interviews.

## üí° Why Swift?

While most competitive programming resources use C++ or Python, I chose Swift because:

- It‚Äôs **safe, modern, and fast**‚Äîperfect for iOS/macOS developers.
- Its syntax is clean and easy for beginners to read.
- Strong typing and optionals make it a great language for practicing **robust problem-solving**.

## üöÄ How to Use This Repo

1. Pick a topic folder (e.g., `arrays/`).
2. Read the theory summary in the folder (if available).
3. Try solving the same problem on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) or another platform.
4. Check my `.swift` file to see how I solved it.
5. Clone this repo to practice offline.

## üîÆ Next Steps

- Expand coverage of advanced algorithms (DP, backtracking, graph algorithms).
- Add more Swift templates for competitive programming.
- Keep documenting solutions and topics consistently.
